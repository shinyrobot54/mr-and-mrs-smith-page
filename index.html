        <p>
        While perhaps best remembered as the movie in which Angelina Jolie and Brad
        Pitt became star-crossed lovers, <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i> deserves more attention than your
        typical A-list action movie. In particular, the film’s trenchant critique of suburbia,
        marriage, and the lies we tell each other every day make it a relevant, contemporary
        movie.
        </p>

        <p>
        As the film is now almost 10 years old, I will be revealing some mild spoilers
        in this review, but it should not be enough to disturb enjoyment of the movie.
        </p>

        <h2 id="slow-death">A Slow Death In Suburbia</h2>

        <p>
        The very first scene of the movie with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith
        features them in the modern suburban torture chamber: therapy in the office of a marriage
        counselor. While denying that they need any kind of help (“Just a maintenance checkup”
        John claims) it is obvious that they are deeply uncomfortable in each other’s presence,
        a rawness helped by the fact that this was the first scene shot in the film.
        <sup><a href="#footnote">*</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
        As told in flashback, the couple originally met under dramatic and emotionally
        heightened circumstances in Panama, framing both their attraction and the cause of their
        self-destruction. Each is an assassin for a rival company, but instinctively uses their
        cover as a civilian contractor from the moment they meet, successfully fooling each other
        for the first six years of their relationship. It is this same deceit that threatens the
        end of their marriage.
        </p>

        <p>
        In this way the film is very similar to <a
        href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/">True Lies</a>, the action-comedy film
        directed 10 years earlier by James Cameron. However, in that film the deceit was
        almost entirely one-sided, the manipulation significantly more disturbing, and
        (being a Cameron- Schwarzenegger film) focused much more on spectacle.
        </p>

        <p>
        Seeing each other as equals, it quickly becomes apparent that John and Jane
        are very different people. Jane is reserved, precise, analytical, poised; her husband is
        rough-and-tumble, raw and improvisational. Every remaining bit of their energy is devoted
        to maintaining a successful cover: a fine house, the latest model cars. But it is only in
        danger and risk that they come alive: life in suburbia is boredom and ennui, and it’s
        clear that they can’t wait to escape the prison they have built for themselves each
        day.
        </p>

        <h2>Marching Orders</h2>

        <p>
        When their respective employers discover who they work for, John and Jane are
        set to kill each other. While these first attempts fail, the seething resentment
        of both wife and husband fuels a series of mounting revenge attacks. Their
        destruction comes almost gleeful – you can see them actually enjoying themselves
        in competition with each other – and ultimately frees them from the web of lies
        they have spun.
        </p>

        <img class="center" src="images/gunfight-in-the-department-store.jpg" id="gunfight">

        <p>
        Having failed in eliminating their rival, the previously inimical companies
        contracting John and Jane temporarily put aside their differences to end the problem of
        the Smiths, driving them closer together in survival instinct. The last third of the movie
        is the fight of John and Jane against the joined forces of their companies, culminating in
        a final showdown reminiscent of the climax in
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
        While it is not without its faults (in particular Vincent Vaughn’s
        misogynistic, eternally frustrated character has become all too familiar in too many
        movies), <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i> also has a significant share of charm. The chemistry between
        Pitt and Jolie is natural and unfeigned, and the film mixes great action sequences with a
        barded critique of modern suburban life, and it remains, on the whole, one of my favorite
        films.

        <p id="footnote">
        * (Sadly, the rest of the film was not shot chronologically: I was feel that
        doing so imparts an extra emotional verisimilitude to an actor’s performance, as they
        can express the emotional arc of their character in the same sequence that the audience
        experiences it.
